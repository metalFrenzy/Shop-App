# Lonely Shop 

It is a shop app that allows users to view products and them to the cart view their past orders and also mark them as favorites. 

## Main Functionality of the App

* Users can view products and their details 
* Users can mark a products as favorite 
* Users can add products to the cart 
* Users can view their orders that they have done 
* Users can add their own products and manage them


## Main packages and services I have used 

I have developed this app using flutter and used Firebase Real-time database and the Firebase Auth REST Api for developing the authentication part of the app. I have used the provider package for state management, it helps me to handle the data of the app like product data, order data, and cart data. Furthermore, I have used the http package to send and handle http requests to get and post data to the database. Last but not least I have used the shared_preferences package to store authentication data on the device storage so I can automatically log in users and log them out after the token expires.
